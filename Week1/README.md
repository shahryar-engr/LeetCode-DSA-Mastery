## Instructions for Week 1:
1. Solve the problems above on LeetCode.
2. For each problem, write your solution in a Python file (e.g., `reverse_array.py`, `merge_sorted_array.py`).
3. Once you've solved each problem, add your Python solutions to the corresponding **Week1** folder in your GitHub repo.
4. Commit your solutions regularly to keep track of your progress.

Best of luck with your practice!
