- [Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)
- [Knapsack Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/knapsack-problem/)
- [Minimum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)

## Practice Problems
### Dynamic Programming Basics
- Implement the Fibonacci sequence using both recursion and dynamic programming.
- Solve the Coin Change problem with minimum number of coins.
- Solve the House Robber problem for maximum amount stolen.

### Intermediate Dynamic Programming
- Find the Longest Common Subsequence of two strings.
- Solve the Knapsack problem (0/1).
- Solve the Unique Paths problem for an MxN grid.

## Suggested Approaches
- **Dynamic Programming Basics**: Start by solving simple problems like Fibonacci and Coin Change, using both recursive and dynamic programming approaches. Focus on understanding the difference between top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation).
- **Intermediate Dynamic Programming**: Once you are comfortable with the basics, move to more complex problems like LCS, Knapsack, and unique paths. Practice recognizing the problem structure to apply dynamic programming.
