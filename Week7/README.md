- [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)
- [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)
- [Sudoku Solver](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/)

## Practice Problems
### Greedy Algorithms
- Solve the Activity Selection problem using a greedy approach.
- Solve the Job Sequencing problem with deadlines.
- Find the minimum cost to connect all points in a 2D plane using a greedy approach.

### Backtracking
- Solve the N-Queens problem using backtracking.
- Find all possible subsets of a set.
- Solve the Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.

## Suggested Approaches
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Greedy algorithms are optimal for problems where a local optimum leads to a global optimum. Try solving problems like Activity Selection and Jump Game using a greedy approach, and understand when it works best.
- **Backtracking**: Start with simple problems like N-Queens and Subsets. Focus on recursion and state-space tree exploration. Practice pruning branches where further exploration isnâ€™t needed.
