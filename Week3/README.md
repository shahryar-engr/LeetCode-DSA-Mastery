## Practice Problems
### Linked Lists
- Reverse a Linked List in groups of K nodes.
- Merge K sorted linked lists.
- Find the middle element of a linked list.

### Recursion
- Solve the Fibonacci series using recursion.
- Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.
- Generate all possible permutations of a given list of numbers.

### Stacks
- Implement a stack using two queues.
- Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
- Evaluate an expression given in Reverse Polish Notation.

## Suggested Approaches
- **Linked List**: Practice iterating through and manipulating nodes. Get comfortable with pointers.
- **Recursion**: Start with basic examples like factorial and Fibonacci, then move on to more complex problems like N-Queens.
- **Stacks**: Understand the stack operations and implement solutions using stack to solve problems like expression evaluation.
