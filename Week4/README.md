## LeetCode Problems
### Hashing
- [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- [Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)
- [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)
- [Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)

### Graph Traversal
- [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
- [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)
- [Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)
- [Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)
- [Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/)

## Practice Problems
### Hashing
- Implement a hash map with basic operations (insert, delete, get).
- Find all pairs in an array that sum up to a given value.
- Find the intersection of two arrays.

### Graph Traversal
- Implement Depth First Search (DFS) on a graph.
- Implement Breadth First Search (BFS) on a graph.
- Find the shortest path in an unweighted graph using BFS.

## Suggested Approaches
- **Hashing**: Focus on understanding collision handling and the efficiency of hash-based structures like HashMap and HashSet.
- **Graph Traversal**: Start by implementing BFS and DFS on simple graphs before tackling more complex graph problems like topological sort or shortest path.
