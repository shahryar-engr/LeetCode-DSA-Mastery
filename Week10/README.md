# LeetCode DSA Mastery Program - Week 10

## Topics Covered
- **Final Project**: This week is dedicated to applying everything you've learned throughout the course. You will work on a comprehensive problem that combines multiple algorithms and data structures.

## LeetCode Problem
- **LeetCode Final Project**: This project is an integration of the various patterns, algorithms, and data structures you've learned. The goal is to solve a complex problem by combining concepts from different areas. 

### Suggested Project
- **LeetCode Challenge**: Create a LeetCode challenge that combines:
  - Graph traversal for finding shortest paths.
  - Dynamic Programming for optimization problems.
  - String manipulation algorithms for pattern matching.
  - Trie for searching and prefix-based queries.
  - Greedy algorithms for optimization.
  - Backtracking for solving combinatorial problems.

### Example Final Project Ideas:
1. **Word Ladder II (Graph + BFS + DFS)**
   - Find the shortest transformation sequence from start word to end word, using a dictionary. Each transformation involves changing only one letter, and the resulting word must exist in the dictionary.

2. **Longest Palindromic Substring (Dynamic Programming + String Manipulation)**
   - Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

3. **Traveling Salesman Problem (Graph + Dynamic Programming + Bitmasking)**
   - Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem by finding the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the origin.

4. **Word Search II (Trie + Backtracking)**
   - Given a 2D board and a list of words, find all the words in the board by using a Trie and backtracking.

## Practice Problems
- Use the problems you have solved in previous weeks as references for this final project. Try to build an integrated solution combining multiple concepts from previous weeks.
- Focus on solving a comprehensive, multi-step problem using different algorithms and data structures.

## Suggested Approach
- Start by analyzing the problem and breaking it down into smaller, manageable subproblems.
- Identify the patterns and algorithms that will be needed to solve each subproblem.
- Implement each subproblem one at a time, and then combine the solutions to form the final solution.
- Refactor the solution for optimal performance, making sure the time and space complexities are as efficient as possible.
