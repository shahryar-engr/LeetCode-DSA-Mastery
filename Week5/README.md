## LeetCode Problems
### Binary Search
- [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)
- [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
- [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
- [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)

### Binary Trees
- [Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)
- [Binary Search Tree Validation](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)
- [Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)
- [Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

## Practice Problems
### Binary Search
- Implement binary search in a sorted array.
- Find the first and last positions of a target element in a sorted array.
- Implement binary search on an infinite sorted array.

### Binary Trees
- Implement tree traversal (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder).
- Check if a tree is balanced.
- Find the maximum depth of a binary tree.
- Find the LCA of two nodes in a binary tree.

## Suggested Approaches
- **Binary Search**: Start by practicing binary search in sorted arrays, and then move to more complex problems like rotated arrays and searching for bounds.
- **Binary Trees**: Focus on mastering tree traversals first, then dive into specific problems like finding the LCA and tree diameter.
