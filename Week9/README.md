- [Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/)
- [Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/)
- [KMP Pattern Matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/)

### Trie
- [Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/)
- [Word Search II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/)
- [Add and Search Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-and-search-word-data-structure-design/)
- [Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)

## Practice Problems
### String Manipulation
- Solve the problem of finding the longest substring without repeating characters.
- Implement string matching algorithms like KMP and Rabin-Karp for pattern searching.
- Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome.

### Trie
- Implement a trie data structure for inserting and searching words.
- Solve the Word Search II problem using a trie.
- Find the longest common prefix in a set of words.

## Suggested Approaches
- **String Manipulation**: Start with simple string problems like finding the longest substring without repeating characters. Then move on to pattern matching algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp) to improve the efficiency of string searches.
- **Trie**: Understand the concept of prefix trees (Tries) and implement basic operations like inserting and searching for words. Practice solving word search and prefix-based problems using the Trie data structure.
