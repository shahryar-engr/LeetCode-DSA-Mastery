# LeetCode DSA Mastery Program

This repository is designed to help you master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through LeetCode. It covers topics from basic to advanced, providing structured weekly content, problems, and explanations to help you understand and practice key algorithms and data structures.

## Course Overview:
The course is divided into **10 weeks**. Each week focuses on specific topics in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, with a strong emphasis on solving problems from **LeetCode**.

- **Week 1**: Arrays, Two Pointers, Searching, Sorting (Easy)
- **Week 2**: Arrays, Two Pointers, Sliding Window (Medium)
- **Week 3**: Linked Lists, Recursion, Stack
- **Week 4**: Hashing, HashMap, Graph Traversal
- **Week 5**: Binary Search, Binary Trees
- **Week 6**: Dynamic Programming (Basic to Intermediate)
- **Week 7**: Greedy Algorithms, Backtracking
- **Week 8**: Advanced DP, Graph Algorithms (Hard)
- **Week 9**: String Manipulation, Trie
- **Week 10**: Final Project (Combine all patterns & algorithms)

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Go through the weekly topics, starting from Week 1.
3. Solve the suggested LeetCode problems for each week.
4. Check out additional resources and links for further learning.
5. Keep track of your progress using the Notion planner (coming soon!).

## Repository Structure:
- **Week-wise README.md files**: Each week has a detailed README.md file with topics, problems, and practice exercises.
- **Final Project**: Week 10 contains a final project that combines all the learning from previous weeks.

Good luck with your LeetCode journey!
